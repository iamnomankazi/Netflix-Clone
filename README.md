# Netflix Clone Project

This project is a functional replica of the popular streaming service Netflix. 
I built the user interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, while the backend leverages Python and Django to power the website functionality.
Users can browse and watch a curated selection of movies and web series. Additionally, the platform implements a recommendation system that suggests content based on your viewing history, providing a personalized experience.
